# WebCrawler-LatexGeneration
The aim of this project is to generate a thesis-like PDF file, which consist of text&paragraphs, pictures, diagrams, equations and references.  
So that the first part of this project is to downloading all required data with web crawling from different source.
And the second task is to combine all the data randomly in a latex file.

## Latex Generation
The generated PDF pages should be devided into two styles. The one called "good page" are those pages only with references. The ohter called "bad page" are those with more than one element(eg. diagrams, equations...). Thus these two different types of pages can be used to train a neural network classifier.
